# Boolean-with-MP-Neuron
McCulloch Pitts neuron or MP Neuron for short is one of the simplest and earliest forms of a computational neuron, it takes binary weights and fires or not fires based on preset thresholds and conditions. In this paper we explore the leveraging of these properties to construct Boolean functions.
